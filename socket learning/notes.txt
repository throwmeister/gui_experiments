With async io i could try and control the flow of commands like this

main(): - main function where logic of operations is handled

await f() - first part of the game
await s() - second part of the game

async f(): - create event loop and run the functions concurrently - display what is needed to each user
    await client request 1 - suspend this function so that the other clients can now request

client server - connecting everyone
